## Server CLI Flags

The Yuzu server binary accepts the following command-line flags. All flags are optional; defaults are shown in the table.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--config` | *(auto)* | Path to `yuzu-server.cfg`. If omitted, uses the default location next to the binary. |
| `--data-dir` | *(config dir)* | Directory for SQLite databases and runtime state files (enrollment tokens, pending agents). Defaults to the parent directory of `--config`. Use this in containerized deployments where the config file is on a read-only mount but databases need a writable volume. The path is resolved to its canonical form at startup (symlinks are followed). Env: `YUZU_DATA_DIR`. |
| `--web-port` | `8080` | HTTP listen port for the dashboard and REST API. |
| `--web-address` | `127.0.0.1` | Web UI bind address. |
| `--no-https` | off | Disable HTTPS (insecure, for development only). HTTPS is **enabled by default**; provide `--https-cert` and `--https-key`, or pass `--no-https` to disable. Env: `YUZU_NO_HTTPS`. |
| `--no-tls` | off | Disable **all** gRPC TLS (agent listener AND management listener). Plaintext gRPC, no encryption, no peer authentication. **The administrative surface is ungated when this flag is passed.** Intended for local UAT, customer demos, and development. The server emits a multi-line ERROR-level startup banner and a 5-minute recurring reminder when running in this mode. |
| `--cert` | *(none)* | Path to PEM-encoded gRPC server certificate for the **agent listener** (port 50051 by default). Env: `YUZU_CERT`. |
| `--key` | *(none)* | Path to PEM-encoded gRPC server private key for the agent listener. The file must not be world-readable (Unix: `chmod 600`). Env: `YUZU_KEY`. |
| `--ca-cert` | *(none)* | Path to PEM-encoded CA certificate used to verify agent client certificates (full mTLS). Without this, the agent listener has no client-cert verification — `--insecure-skip-client-verify` plus `YUZU_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1` is required to start in that posture. Env: `YUZU_CA_CERT`. |
| `--insecure-skip-client-verify` | off | Allow gRPC TLS without `--ca-cert` (one-way TLS — server cert is presented but client certs are not verified). Applies to BOTH the agent listener and the management listener. **Requires `YUZU_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1` in the environment as a second confirmation** — the server refuses to start without it. Renamed from `--allow-one-way-tls` in v0.12.0; the old name is still accepted with a deprecation warning. |
| `--allow-one-way-tls` | off | **[DEPRECATED]** Renamed to `--insecure-skip-client-verify`. Still accepted for backward compatibility with a startup deprecation warning; will be removed in a future release. |
| `--management-cert` | *(none)* | Optional PEM cert for the **management listener** (port 50052 by default). If unset, the management listener reuses the agent listener's certificate. |
| `--management-key` | *(none)* | Optional PEM key for the management listener. If `--management-cert`/`--management-key` are set without `--management-ca-cert`, the same `--insecure-skip-client-verify` + `YUZU_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1` gate applies. |
| `--management-ca-cert` | *(none)* | Optional CA cert for management client cert verification. Without this (and without `--insecure-skip-client-verify`), the management listener refuses to start. |
| `--trusted-nat-cidr` | *(none)* | Comma-separated (or repeatable) CIDR ranges (IPv4 or IPv6) declaring a trusted NAT boundary for **direct-connect** agents. When an agent's Register and Subscribe source IPs *both* fall within one declared range, a per-session peer-IP mismatch is downgraded from a hard reject to an *advisory* (audit `result="ok" outcome=advisory`; counted on `yuzu_grpc_subscribe_peer_advisory_total`) instead of rejecting the stream. Strict exact-match is the default when absent; mismatches outside every declared range still reject (the stolen-session guard stays intact). Use for fleets behind multi-egress NAT, proxy pools, CG-NAT, or SD-WAN where an agent may egress from different public IPs on its two connections. **Security note:** declaring a range asserts the hosts in it are mutually trusted not to replay each other's sessions; keep ranges as narrow as possible (never `0.0.0.0/0`). Malformed entries are logged and ignored at startup. Env: `YUZU_TRUSTED_NAT_CIDR`. |
| `--nat-trust-mtls-identity` | off | Also downgrade a peer-IP mismatch to advisory when the Subscribe mTLS client identity matches the identity bound at Register (#1128). **SAFE ONLY WITH PER-AGENT CLIENT CERTIFICATES.** With a shared/fleet-wide client cert every identity "matches", turning this into a session-replay bypass (an insider agent could hijack another agent's session from its own IP). Off by default; enable only if each agent presents a unique client certificate. When both `--nat-trust-mtls-identity` and `--trusted-nat-cidr` are configured, mTLS-identity match takes precedence: a session whose mTLS identity matches records `reason=mtls_identity_match` (visible on the audit `detail` and the `yuzu_grpc_subscribe_peer_advisory_total{reason=...}` label), and CIDR containment is not consulted for that session. Enabling the flag emits a `warn`-level startup line — confirm it appears in the boot log so the operator who pulled the lever can sign off on the per-agent-cert posture. Env: `YUZU_NAT_TRUST_MTLS_IDENTITY`. |
| `--https-port` | `8443` | HTTPS listen port. |
| `--https-cert` | *(none)* | Path to PEM-encoded TLS certificate file. Required unless `--no-https` is set. |
| `--https-key` | *(none)* | Path to PEM-encoded TLS private key file. Required unless `--no-https` is set. The file must not be world-readable (Unix: `chmod 600`). |
| `--no-https-redirect` | off | When HTTPS is enabled, do not redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. By default, HTTP requests are redirected. |
| `--no-cert-reload` | off | Disable automatic certificate hot-reload. By default, the server polls cert/key files and hot-swaps the SSL context when they change. Env: `YUZU_NO_CERT_RELOAD`. |
| `--cert-reload-interval` | `60` | Certificate reload polling interval in seconds. Minimum effective interval is 10 seconds. Env: `YUZU_CERT_RELOAD_INTERVAL`. |
| `--metrics-no-auth` | off | Allow unauthenticated `/metrics` access from any IP. By default, remote clients must authenticate; localhost access is always unauthenticated. **Warning:** enabling this exposes fleet composition data (OS, architecture, version counts) to any network client. See [Metrics Security](metrics.md#security-considerations). Env: `YUZU_METRICS_NO_AUTH`. |
| `--csp-extra-sources` | *(none)* | Extra Content-Security-Policy source-list entries appended to `script-src`, `style-src`, `connect-src`, and `img-src`. Space-separated string of host/scheme expressions or whitelisted CSP keywords (`'self'`, `'none'`, `'sha256-...'`, `'sha384-...'`, `'sha512-...'`, `'nonce-...'`). The server **refuses to start** if the value contains control bytes, semicolons, commas, or unsafe CSP keywords like `'unsafe-eval'`. Use to whitelist customer CDNs, monitoring beacons, or analytics endpoints. See [HTTP Security Response Headers](security-hardening.md#http-security-response-headers). Env: `YUZU_CSP_EXTRA_SOURCES`. |
| `--oidc-issuer` | *(none)* | OIDC identity provider issuer URL (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0`). |
| `--oidc-client-id` | *(none)* | OIDC application (client) ID. |
| `--oidc-client-secret` | *(none)* | OIDC client secret. |
| `--oidc-redirect-uri` | *(auto)* | OIDC redirect URI. If omitted, auto-computed from the web address and port. Must match the registered redirect in your identity provider. |
| `--oidc-admin-group` | *(none)* | Entra ID group object ID that maps to the admin role. Users in this group are granted admin access on OIDC login. |
| `--oidc-skip-tls-verify` | off | Disable TLS certificate verification for OIDC endpoints. **Insecure — dev only.** Env: `YUZU_OIDC_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY`. |
| `--mcp-disable` | off | Disable the MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint entirely. When set, all requests to `/mcp/v1/` are rejected with a JSON-RPC error. Use this in air-gapped or high-security environments where AI integration is not desired. Env: `YUZU_MCP_DISABLE`. |
| `--mcp-read-only` | off | Restrict MCP to read-only tools only. Write and execute operations (Phase 2) are rejected even if the MCP token's tier would normally allow them. Env: `YUZU_MCP_READ_ONLY`. |
| `--viz-disable` | off | Disable the fleet visualization feature. When set, the REST endpoints (`GET /api/v1/viz/fleet/topology`, `GET /fragments/viz/fleet/topology`, and the per-host drill-down routes) **and** the page shells (`GET /viz/fleet`, `GET /viz/host/<id>`) all return `503`. Tier-before-permission ordering: the kill switch takes effect even for callers who would otherwise fail RBAC. Two pieces of durable evidence that the switch took effect: the startup log line `[VIZ] viz endpoint disabled by configuration`, and a `server.viz_disabled` audit event (`target_type = FleetTopology`) written to the audit store at boot — so an auditor can confirm the disabled state from the audit trail even on a deployment with no viz traffic. Env: `YUZU_VIZ_DISABLE`. |
| `--allow-unsigned-packs` | off | **Dangerous.** Accept product packs at install without an Ed25519 signature. Default is to reject unsigned packs with `pack '<name>' is unsigned and signature enforcement is enabled (set --allow-unsigned-packs / YUZU_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_PACKS=1 to bypass)` (security-by-default since #802 / W7.4). Setting this flag restores the pre-W7.4 behaviour where any operator with pack-upload permission, or a MITM on pack delivery, could install a pack containing arbitrary `InstructionDefinition` or plugin payloads that would execute fleet-wide. Two pieces of durable evidence that the flag is active: a startup log line `[SECURITY] product pack signature enforcement DISABLED by configuration`, and a `server.unsigned_packs_allowed` audit event (`target_type = ProductPack`) written to the audit store at boot. Use only as a temporary migration aid; sign your packs and remove the flag as soon as feasible. Env: `YUZU_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_PACKS`. |
| `--allow-unsigned-definitions` | off | **Dangerous.** Accept `InstructionDefinition` imports via `POST /api/v1/instructions/import` without an Ed25519 signature. Default is to reject unsigned imports with `instruction-import is unsigned and signature enforcement is enabled (set --allow-unsigned-definitions / YUZU_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_DEFINITIONS=1 to bypass)` (security-by-default since #1073 / W7.4 sibling-gap closure). Closes the equivalent fleet-RCE surface that `--allow-unsigned-packs` covers on the ProductPack side: without enforcement, any operator with `InstructionDefinition:Write` (or a MITM on a content sync) can publish a definition that dispatches a malicious plugin invocation on every targeted agent. Durable evidence: startup log line `[SECURITY] instruction-definition signature enforcement DISABLED by configuration` AND a `server.unsigned_definitions_allowed` audit event (`target_type = InstructionDefinition`). Env: `YUZU_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_DEFINITIONS`. |
| `--log-file` | *(none)* | Path for explicit on-disk log output. When set, log lines are written to this file in addition to stdout. The directory must be writable by the server's runtime user; if the file or directory cannot be opened the server logs an ERROR but continues to start. Independent of the default platform log path (see [File Logging](#file-logging)). |

## Configuration Files

The server stores its configuration in files located in the **same directory as the `yuzu-server` binary**. These files are created automatically during first-run setup and updated through the Settings page.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `yuzu-server.cfg` | First-boot seed for `auth.db`. Holds the initial admin credential as PBKDF2-SHA256 with a per-user salt. After first boot, `auth.db` is authoritative and this file is no longer read for live state — keep it as the seed for disaster-recovery (re-creating `auth.db` from scratch). |
| `auth.db` | SQLite-backed authentication database. Holds user accounts, sessions, and enrollment tokens with PBKDF2-SHA256 hashed passwords. Created in `--data-dir` on first boot. Mode `0600` on Linux; restricted ACL on Windows. **This is the live source of truth for authentication state from v0.12.0 onwards.** |
| `enrollment-tokens.cfg` | Legacy enrollment-token file (Tier 2). New deployments persist tokens inside `auth.db`; this file remains writable for backwards-compatibility on upgrades from pre-AuthDB releases. |
| `pending-agents.cfg` | Queue of agents awaiting manual approval (Tier 1 enrollment). Contains agent ID, hostname, IP, and registration timestamp. |

> **Backup recommendation:** Back up `auth.db` (use `sqlite3 auth.db ".backup ..."`, NEVER `cp` against a live WAL DB), `yuzu-server.cfg`, and the rest of the `--data-dir` SQLite stores on the same schedule. Losing `auth.db` AND `yuzu-server.cfg` requires re-running `--first-run-setup` to create a new admin. Losing `auth.db` alone is recoverable — see `docs/ops-runbooks/auth-db-recovery.md`.

> **File permissions (Unix):** `auth.db` is created with mode `0600` (owner read/write only); `yuzu-server.cfg`, `enrollment-tokens.cfg`, and `pending-agents.cfg` are also `0600` after every write. No manual `chmod` is required.

> **Windows Defender exclusion:** On Windows production deploys, exclude `auth.db`, `auth.db-wal`, and `auth.db-shm` from real-time scan. See `docs/ops-runbooks/auth-db-recovery.md` for the `Add-MpPreference` commands.

---

## First-Run Setup

When the server starts for the first time and no `yuzu-server.cfg` exists, it enters **interactive setup mode** on the terminal. The setup prompts for:

1. **Admin username** -- the initial administrator account.
2. **Admin password** -- entered twice for confirmation. Stored as a PBKDF2 hash.

After setup completes, the server writes `yuzu-server.cfg` and starts normally. Subsequent restarts skip the setup prompt.

> **Headless deployment:** For automated or containerized deployments, pre-create `yuzu-server.cfg` with PBKDF2-hashed password entries before starting the server for the first time. A sample config with default credentials is provided below for quick evaluation.

### Default Credentials (Evaluation Only)

For Docker, automated, and quick-start deployments, the following `yuzu-server.cfg` ships with pre-hashed credentials so the server starts without interactive setup:

| Username | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `administrator` | Admin (full access) |
| `user` | `useroperator` | User (read-only) |

> **WARNING: Change these credentials immediately after first login.** These defaults are published in documentation and are not suitable for production. Use the Settings page (User Management) to change passwords and create new accounts. For enterprise deployments, integrate OIDC SSO and disable local accounts.

## Upgrade Notes

### v0.10.0 — API token revocation is owner-scoped

Starting with v0.10.0, non-admin users can no longer revoke API tokens they do not own. A caller holding the `ApiToken:Delete` permission may revoke only tokens whose `principal_id` matches the session's username; the global `admin` role is the sole bypass. Prior releases allowed any holder of `ApiToken:Delete` to revoke any token, which was an IDOR (tracked in GitHub issue #222).

**If your deployment uses a non-admin service account to rotate tokens for other principals** — for example, a shared `ops` role that recycles service-account tokens on a schedule — those rotations will begin receiving `HTTP 404 token not found` after upgrade. To restore the behavior, either:

1. Assign the rotation account the global `admin` role, or
2. Refactor the rotation so each principal owns and rotates its own token.

Option (2) is the recommended long-term posture because it aligns with least-privilege. The same ownership constraint applies to both the REST path `DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{id}` and the HTMX dashboard path `DELETE /api/settings/api-tokens/{id}`. Denied attempts are recorded in the audit log with `action=api_token.revoke`, `result=denied`, and `detail=owner=<real owner>` so operators can distinguish an enumeration probe from a legitimate self-revoke.

Both paths return `HTTP 404 token not found` on a cross-user revoke attempt — identical to the response for a truly-nonexistent token — to prevent the endpoint from being used as an enumeration oracle.

### v0.12.0 — TAR dashboard page + mixed-version agent caveats

The new `/tar` dashboard page (issue #547) surfaces every device × source pair where a TAR collector has been disabled. The page is reachable from the **TAR** entry in the main navigation bar; viewing requires `Infrastructure:Read` and the per-source Re-enable / Scan-fleet actions require `Execution:Execute`.

**Mixed-version rollout caveat.** Agents running a build older than v0.12.0 do not emit the new per-source `paused_at` / `live_rows` / `oldest_ts` lines on `tar.status`. The dashboard renders an em-dash (`—`) for those columns when a pre-v0.12.0 agent appears in a scan result. This is not a server bug — it is an honest "we don't know when this collector was disabled because the agent reporting it pre-dates the field." Operators upgrading the server before the agent fleet should expect the em-dash for any pre-existing paused sources until the agent at the affected device is upgraded. See `docs/user-manual/tar.md` for the full TAR dashboard workflow.

**Per-operator scan state caveat.** Scan results are held in the server's memory keyed by operator username, with a 30-second per-operator cooldown to defend against retry-storms. Restarting the server clears all scan state; operators will see "No scan data yet — click Scan fleet" after a restart and a fresh scan returns within seconds. Persistence across restarts and multi-server coordination land in Phase 15.G operational hardening.

**Audit log additions.** Two new audit actions emit on operator activity: `tar.status.scan` (every Scan-fleet click; `result=success`/`denied`/`failure` with detail) and `tar.source.reenable` (every Re-enable click; `result=success`/`denied`/`failure`). SIEM rules can distinguish forged form submissions from genuine connectivity failures via the `detail=scope_violation` vs `detail=agent_not_connected` distinction even though the HTTP response body is identical (`Agent not reachable.` 404) for both cases — the body identity is load-bearing for the no-enumeration-oracle property.

### vNEXT — Fleet visualization (3D) (`/viz/fleet`)

The fleet-visualization feature ladder lands across the `feat/viz-engine` branch. PRs 1–12 are shipped: agent collector + server store + REST/fragment routes + page scaffold + camera controls + cube renderer + Sprite labels + hover tooltip + interior process nodes coloured by category + intra-cube localhost edges + per-cube listening-socket spheres + cross-machine connection edges + push-based topology ingestion + **three-tier stacked layout, talking-socket dots, curved tube wires, loopback-bind filter (PR 12)**. Remaining ladder PRs add the vulnerability overlay and final polish (LOD, edge bundling, a11y, perf).

**Operator-visible state today (PRs 1–12).** Navigating to `/viz/fleet` shows one translucent cube per fleet machine, **organized into three architectural tiers** — frontend cubes on the top Y plane, applications in the middle plane, databases on the bottom plane. Within each tier, machines fall onto a deterministic per-tier grid (FNV-1a hash on `agent_id`). Live agents render at opacity `0.18`; stale agents (no `tar.fleet_snapshot` push within the staleness threshold) drop to `0.08`. Per-OS palette: Linux `#f0c674`, macOS/Darwin `#a0a0a0`, Windows `#5294e2`. Hostname `Sprite` labels render below each cube. Inside each cube, one `SphereGeometry` dot per process is laid out deterministically (`hash(pid|ppid)`-mod-bucket inside the cube's interior) and coloured from a six-category palette: system `#6e7681`, browser `#58a6ff`, database `#d29922`, web `#56d364`, runtime `#bc8cff`, other `#8b949e`. Each cube's TOP face carries a ring of cream-coloured listening-socket spheres (one per `listeners[]` row) with `:port` labels; **loopback-only listeners (`127.x`, `::1`) are now hidden from the surface** — they aren't reachable from other instances. Each cube's BOTTOM face carries a ring of cool-blue **talking-socket** dots (one per unique outbound `(proto, dst_ip, dst_port)`). **Cross-machine connections render as thick curved tubes** (`THREE.TubeGeometry` along a `CubicBezierCurve3` with vertical end-tangents) that drop from the source's talking dot down/across to the destination's listener sphere. External (off-fleet) destinations render as short grey stub lines with ring markers. Hover order: listener sockets → talking sockets → process dots → edges → cubes. WASD pans, drag rotates, wheel zooms.

**Tier classification heuristic.** `classifyTier` reads `listeners[]` port hints (`DB_PORTS = {3306, 5432, 6379, 27017, 1521, 1433, 9042, 9200, 5984, 8086, 11211}` / `WEB_PORTS = {80, 443, 8080, 8443, 8088}`) plus process-category strings (`'database'`, `'web'`). Priority is **db > web > app**: a host with any DB signal lands on the database tier regardless of whether it also serves web traffic. A host with no DB or web signal defaults to the application tier. **Known limitations:** (a) databases on non-standard ports (e.g. Postgres on 5431 for a sharded cluster) fall through to the application tier unless one of the host's processes is classified as `database` by `process_category.hpp`; (b) `WEB_PORTS` is intentionally narrow — it covers reverse proxies / load balancers / API gateways on ports 80/443/8080/8443/8088 but **not** dev-server defaults (3000/4200/5173/8000), because in a classic three-tier deployment a nodejs/django/vite server listening on those ports is application work, not the front edge. There is no operator-accessible override today; both limitations are tracked as a follow-up issue on function-aware tier classification.

**Why empty cubes show no lines.** Intra-cube edges appear only for processes with *active* loopback socket pairs (e.g. Prometheus scraping node_exporter, a client connected to a local Redis / Postgres). A fresh agent with no inter-process loopback traffic shows process dots but no lines — this is expected, not a bug. Lines appear as workloads generate loopback flows.

**Browser requirements.** The page uses ES module imports resolved through an `<script type="importmap">` declaration. importmap is supported in Chrome 89+, Firefox 108+, Safari 16.4+, and Edge 89+ (all browsers shipped after early 2023). Older browsers receive a visible error overlay on the page rather than a blank canvas — the page detects via `HTMLScriptElement.supports('importmap')` before attempting the module load. **`MeshPhysicalMaterial` cubes additionally require WebGL 2.0**, which is bundled with all browsers in the import-map support floor but can be disabled by enterprise group policy on locked-down terminals. Browsers without WebGL 2 will see the grid but the cubes will fail to render with a black or missing material; verify WebGL 2 is enabled in browser policy before pilot rollout. Operators on enterprise-locked browser configurations that lag 2+ years should test on a representative deployment. **Page weight:** the `/viz/fleet` route pulls three.js (~685 KB), three-orbit (~32 KB), htmx (~51 KB), the yuzu-viz renderer (~84 KB), plus the design-system CSS. Approximate first-load total is ~1.5 MB of JS (uncompressed). For metered-link or low-bandwidth deployments, consider `--viz-disable` as a default and enabling it selectively for ops staff.

**Reverse-proxy deployment constraint.** The page hard-codes static asset paths (`/static/three.module.min.js`, `/static/three-orbit-controls.js`, `/static/yuzu-viz.js`) and the API path (`/api/v1/viz/fleet/topology`). Sub-path proxy deployments (e.g. nginx `location /yuzu/`) are NOT supported — the absolute paths would 404 against the rewritten origin. Mount Yuzu at the root path of its host or a fronting domain.

**Cache posture.** The `/viz/fleet` page response sets `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` so a server upgrade cannot leave operators with a stale page that references the new vendored assets (which themselves cache for 24 hours via `max-age=86400`). The vendored asset bundles are content-addressed by server binary version — a fresh page revalidation after upgrade picks up any bundle changes immediately.

**Kill switch behaviour.** `--viz-disable` / `YUZU_VIZ_DISABLE` disables the **whole feature**: the REST/fragment endpoints, the per-host drill-down routes, **and** the `/viz/fleet` and `/viz/host/<id>` page shells all return `503` (a plain-text "fleet visualization is disabled by an administrator" body). An operator who sets the flag will not see a half-working page. The static asset routes (`/static/yuzu-viz.js` etc.) are not gated — they are inert without the page — so gating them at a reverse proxy is optional, not required. The kill switch is **boot-time only** (seeded from config at startup); there is no runtime toggle, so disabling viz under a live incident requires a server restart.

**Sizing and capacity.** Push-based ingestion holds one `RawAgentSnapshot` per agent in an in-memory `pushed_` map. Per-agent footprint is bounded by the parser caps (4096 processes + 4096 connections per snapshot, ~1–2 MB worst case, typically 5–20 KB). The map is hard-capped at **100 000 agents** (`kPushedMapHardCap`); at the cap, a new agent's push evicts the least-recently-seen entry (LRU by server receipt time) and emits a `topology.push.evicted_for_cap` audit event. Watch `yuzu_viz_pushed_map_size` and alert before it approaches the cap. The store is **in-memory only** — on server restart it is empty until agents re-push (recovery window ≈ one agent push cycle, ~30–60 s); the pull-based dispatch fetcher serves as the cold-start fallback during that window.

**Permission model.** The page route is auth-gated only (`require_auth`); the data fetch at `GET /api/v1/viz/fleet/topology` enforces `Response:Read`. An operator with a session but without `Response:Read` can land on the page (sees the grid and the "Access denied" overlay when the JS fetch fires) but every JSON fetch returns 403. The `viz.fleet_topology` audit row is emitted on the API path, not the page path — auditors querying "who accessed fleet visualization?" should filter on the `FleetTopology` `target_type` (covered in detail in `audit-log.md`).

**Browser-side errors are not server-logged.** WebGL context loss, module-fetch 503, and importmap-resolution failures surface only in the operator's browser console. A future polish PR will add a client-error beacon; today, support engineers diagnosing "viz is blank" reports should ask for a screenshot of the browser console.

**Per-host drill-down (`/viz/host/<agent_id>`).** Double-clicking a cube
opens a new tab with a 2D bipartite IPC graph (processes + sockets,
Cytoscape `cose` layout) above the existing TAR process tree, with
cross-pane select-to-highlight and a resizable splitter. The page route
is auth-gated only; the data fetch (`GET /api/v1/viz/host/<agent_id>/topology`)
enforces `Response:Read` and honours the `--viz-disable` kill switch.
Audit rows are emitted as `viz.host_topology` (`target_type = HostTopology`).
The `agent_id` path segment is allow-listed to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` before
templating; any other character returns `400`.

**Connection window — `fleet_snapshot_window_seconds` (TAR plugin config).**
`tar.fleet_snapshot` reports not only the connections ESTABLISHED at the
exact `/proc` sample instant but also connections TAR observed recently
in its `tcp_live` warehouse, so short-lived flows still reach the viz.
The look-back window is operator-tunable via the TAR plugin's KV config
key `fleet_snapshot_window_seconds` (default `3600`). It is a TAR plugin
config key, not a server CLI flag — set it through the TAR plugin's
configuration surface. The 60 s sampler still cannot see sub-interval
connections; that needs kernel eventing (tracked separately).

### vNEXT — Agent interval triggers now functional

`yuzu_register_trigger` / `yuzu_unregister_trigger` were previously no-op
stubs — no `TriggerEngine` was instantiated on the agent, so interval
triggers were silently discarded and never fired. As a result the TAR
warehouse `*_live` tables (`tcp_live` and friends) sat permanently empty
in the field, and any plugin that registered an interval trigger had it
silently dropped.

**Upgrade caveat.** After upgrading the **agent** daemon, registered
interval triggers begin firing for the first time. On the first
`collect_fast` cycle (default 60 s) the TAR `*_live` tables start
populating, and operators may see a small increase in per-agent CPU/IO
proportional to the number of registered triggers. Any plugin that
registered an interval trigger expecting the old no-op behaviour will now
have that trigger fire — this is the fix, not a regression. Server-only
upgrades are unaffected; the change is entirely agent-side.

### vNEXT — Plugin code signing (#80)

Plugin signature verification ships in two parts: an agent-side CMS verifier and a server-side Settings UI for managing the trust bundle. **Default behaviour is unchanged** — agents that do not pass `--plugin-trust-bundle` and operators that do not upload a bundle through the new Settings card see identical behaviour to prior releases (allowlist-only, sha256 hash check).

**New on-disk artifact.** `<cert-dir>/plugin-trust-bundle.pem` (Linux/macOS: `/etc/yuzu/certs/plugin-trust-bundle.pem`; Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Yuzu\certs\plugin-trust-bundle.pem`). Server-managed via Settings → Plugin Code Signing. **Back this up alongside `auth.db`.** A backup that captures the SQLite databases but not the cert dir restores `plugin_signing_required=true` (in `runtime_config`) without the trust bundle file — agents fetching the policy will receive a 500 and require-mode agents will reject every plugin until the bundle is restored.

**Cert-dir collision check.** The server now treats this filename as authoritative. If a prior deployment placed an unrelated PEM at this exact path for a different purpose, it will be interpreted as the plugin trust bundle on first read. This is unlikely (the filename was unused before this release) but worth confirming before upgrade. Run `ls <cert-dir>/plugin-trust-bundle.pem` and rename the file if it pre-exists for any other purpose.

**New `runtime_config` key.** `plugin_signing_required` (string `"true"` or `"false"`). Set via the Settings card; reading and writing the key directly via the runtime-config REST surface is supported but not recommended — the Settings UI guarantees the disk-and-DB invariants (two-phase clear, file-presence-equals-enabled).

**New audit actions.** `plugin_signing.bundle.uploaded`, `plugin_signing.bundle.cleared`, `plugin_signing.require.changed` — see `audit-log.md` for the result and detail conventions. SIEM rules already filtering on `success`/`failure`/`denied` will pick these up unchanged; no new vocabulary tokens.

**Operator distribution.** The server hosts the bundle at `GET /api/v1/agent/plugin-policy` (admin-only). Agents are pointed at a local copy via `--plugin-trust-bundle <path>`; the manual workflow today is `curl` + `jq` + write the JSON's `trust_bundle_pem` field to disk on each agent host. Automatic agent-side fetch is a forthcoming change.

**Fleet-suicide caveat.** The Yuzu release pipeline does not yet sign the 44 in-tree plugins under `agents/plugins/`. **Do NOT enable "Require signed plugins" until you have signed every plugin your fleet uses, including the in-tree ones.** Use the transitional mode (bundle uploaded, Require off) during rollout. The Settings card surfaces this warning inline.

### vNEXT — Response templates (#254, Phase 8.2)

Phase 8.2 ships named response-view configurations attached to each `InstructionDefinition`: a column subset, sort order, and filter presets the dashboard's filter-bar **View** dropdown surfaces. The feature is purely additive — operators who never author a template see a synthesised `__default__` view that is byte-identical in behaviour to the prior "show all columns, sort by Agent" default.

**Schema migration.** `instruction_definitions` gains one column: `response_templates_spec TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'`. The migration ledger advances from v2 to v3. `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with a constant default is O(1) in SQLite (metadata-only, no table rewrite); the migration is non-destructive.

**Pre-upgrade snapshot (recommended).** Take a backup of the InstructionStore database before upgrade:

```bash
cp /var/lib/yuzu/instructions.db /var/lib/yuzu/instructions.db.bak
# or, for a hot-running server, use SQLite's online backup:
sqlite3 /var/lib/yuzu/instructions.db ".backup /var/lib/yuzu/instructions.db.bak"
```

**Post-upgrade validation.**

```bash
sqlite3 /var/lib/yuzu/instructions.db \
  "SELECT version FROM schema_meta WHERE store='instruction_store';"
# expected output: 3
```

If the value is `2` instead of `3`, the migration did not run — check the server logs for `MigrationRunner: instruction_store migrated to v3` (or for a `probe-and-stamp failed` line in the InstructionStore section).

**Boot wedge recovery.** A corrupt schema_meta row or a pre-existing `response_templates_spec` column with a missing schema_meta v3 stamp will trip the probe-and-stamp guard, which fails closed (server logs `InstructionStore: probe-and-stamp failed; closing database`). To recover, restore the snapshot or apply the column manually:

```bash
# Stop the server first.
systemctl stop yuzu-server

sqlite3 /var/lib/yuzu/instructions.db \
  "ALTER TABLE instruction_definitions ADD COLUMN response_templates_spec TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]';"
sqlite3 /var/lib/yuzu/instructions.db \
  "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO schema_meta (store, version, upgraded_at) VALUES ('instruction_store', 3, strftime('%s','now'));"

systemctl start yuzu-server
```

**New audit actions.** `response_template.create`, `response_template.update`, `response_template.delete` — see `audit-log.md` for the failure-reason vocabulary. SIEM rules already filtering on `success`/`denied` will pick these up unchanged.

**Authoring caveats.** The dashboard YAML editor's lightweight line-scanner does not extract `spec.responseTemplates` into the indexed column; author through `POST /api/v1/definitions/import` (JSON envelope) or the REST template endpoints. Imported templates with the reserved `id: __default__` are silently dropped during normalisation.

---

## Settings Page

The Settings page is the primary administrative interface. It is accessible only to users with the **admin** role and is rendered server-side using HTMX.

**URL:** `/settings` (redirects to `/login` if unauthenticated or non-admin)

The Settings page is organized into sections, each loaded as an HTMX fragment. Changes take effect immediately without a server restart unless otherwise noted.

### Sections

| Section | Fragment Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| TLS Configuration | `/fragments/settings/tls` | Enable/disable HTTPS, upload PEM certificate and key files. |
| User Management | `/fragments/settings/users` | Create and delete local user accounts. |
| Enrollment Tokens | `/fragments/settings/tokens` | Generate and revoke tokens for Tier 2 agent enrollment. |
| Pending Agents | `/fragments/settings/pending` | Approve or deny agents waiting in the Tier 1 approval queue. |
| Auto-Approval Policies | `/fragments/settings/auto-approve` | Define rules for automatically approving agents based on criteria (hostname pattern, IP range, etc.). |
| API Tokens | `/fragments/settings/api-tokens` | Create and revoke bearer tokens for REST API automation. |
| Plugin Code Signing | `/fragments/settings/plugin-signing` | Upload a PEM trust bundle for agent plugin CMS signature verification, toggle the require-signed-plugins flag, and remove the bundle. The trust bundle persists at `<cert-dir>/plugin-trust-bundle.pem`; the require flag persists in `runtime_config` under key `plugin_signing_required`. Distribution to agents is operator-driven today (curl into a local file referenced by `--plugin-trust-bundle`); automatic agent-side fetch is a forthcoming change. See the user-manual *Agent Plugins → Plugin Code Signing* section. |
| OTA Updates | `/fragments/settings/updates` | Upload agent binaries, view available versions, promote a version to production. |
| Tag Compliance | `/fragments/settings/tag-compliance` | View compliance summary across the fleet based on tag-driven policies. |
| RBAC Management | *(planned -- no fragment yet)* | Enable or disable RBAC enforcement, create and manage roles. RBAC is enforced via `RbacStore` and the `/api/v1/rbac/*` REST API, but has no Settings page fragment yet. |
| OIDC SSO / Directory | `/fragments/settings/directory` | Configure OIDC single sign-on (issuer, client ID, secret, admin group). Editable form with "Test Connection" button. Changes persisted to runtime config and survive restart. |

---

## TLS Configuration

The Yuzu server has **two independent TLS surfaces**:

1. **HTTPS** — the dashboard and REST API (port 8443 by default). Configured via `--https-cert` / `--https-key` (or runtime via the Settings page). Disabled with `--no-https`.
2. **gRPC TLS** — the agent listener (port 50051) and the management listener (port 50052). Configured via `--cert` / `--key` / `--ca-cert` (and optionally `--management-cert` / `--management-key` / `--management-ca-cert` for a separate management cert). Disabled entirely with `--no-tls`.

The two surfaces are configured separately and can be in different states (e.g., HTTPS enabled but gRPC TLS disabled for a local UAT against a remote dashboard).

### HTTPS via CLI Flags

HTTPS is enabled by default. Pass `--https-cert` and `--https-key` at server startup. Use `--no-https` for development without TLS. See [Server CLI Flags](#server-cli-flags).

### gRPC TLS via CLI Flags

The recommended posture is **mutual TLS (mTLS)** — the server presents a certificate and verifies a client certificate from each connecting agent:

```bash
./yuzu-server \
  --cert /etc/yuzu/grpc-server.crt \
  --key  /etc/yuzu/grpc-server.key \
  --ca-cert /etc/yuzu/agent-clients-ca.crt
```

If you have not yet stood up a CA for issuing agent client certificates, you have two fallback options:

**Option 1 — One-way TLS** (server cert is presented but client certs are not verified):

```bash
export YUZU_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1   # required as a second confirmation
./yuzu-server \
  --cert /etc/yuzu/grpc-server.crt \
  --key  /etc/yuzu/grpc-server.key \
  --insecure-skip-client-verify
```

This applies to **both** the agent listener and the management listener. The server emits an ERROR-level startup banner and a 5-minute recurring reminder log line for the duration the listener runs in this mode. An audit event with action `server.tls_degraded` is also written every 5 minutes for SOC 2 evidence.

**Option 2 — `--no-tls`** (no encryption, no peer authentication, plaintext gRPC):

```bash
./yuzu-server --no-tls
```

This is the supported posture for **local UAT, customer demos, and development**. The administrative surface is ungated — anyone reachable on port 50052 can issue management RPCs. The server emits a multi-line ERROR-level startup banner and a 5-minute recurring reminder. Do not run `--no-tls` against any network you do not control end-to-end.

### Upgrade note (v0.12.0)

The `--allow-one-way-tls` flag was renamed to `--insecure-skip-client-verify` AND now requires `YUZU_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1` in the environment as a second confirmation. **Existing deployments that pass `--allow-one-way-tls` (or the new flag name) will refuse to start after upgrade until the env var is set.** The old flag name remains accepted with a deprecation warning for one release.

For systemd-managed deployments, add the env var via a drop-in:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit yuzu-server   # creates /etc/systemd/system/yuzu-server.service.d/override.conf
```

```ini
[Service]
Environment="YUZU_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1"
```

### Via Settings Page

1. Navigate to **Settings > TLS Configuration**.
2. Toggle **Enable HTTPS**.
3. Upload PEM-encoded certificate and private key files using the **Upload PEM** button, or paste PEM content directly using the **Paste PEM** button.
4. The server begins serving HTTPS on the configured port. By default, HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS.

### Certificate Requirements

- Format: PEM-encoded.
- The certificate file may contain the full chain (leaf + intermediates).
- The private key must not be password-protected.
- On Unix, the private key file must not be readable by group or others. The server will refuse to start if permissions are too open. Fix with: `chmod 600 /path/to/key.pem`.
- For production, use certificates signed by a trusted CA. Self-signed certificates work but require agents to trust the CA.

### Certificate Hot-Reload

The server automatically detects when HTTPS certificate or key files change on disk and hot-swaps the SSL context **without requiring a restart**. This enables zero-downtime certificate rotation, including automated renewal via ACME/certbot.

**How it works:**

1. The server polls the cert and key file modification times at a configurable interval (default: 60 seconds).
2. When a change is detected, the new files are validated:
   - PEM format is parseable
   - Certificate and private key match
   - Key file permissions are secure (Unix: not group/others-readable)
   - Files are not empty and not larger than 1 MB
3. If validation passes, the SSL context is updated atomically. New connections use the new certificate; existing connections are unaffected.
4. If validation fails, the current certificate is preserved and an error is logged.

**Configuration:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--no-cert-reload` | off | Disable automatic hot-reload. Env: `YUZU_NO_CERT_RELOAD`. |
| `--cert-reload-interval` | `60` | Polling interval in seconds. Minimum: 10s. Env: `YUZU_CERT_RELOAD_INTERVAL`. |

**Best practice for atomic file replacement:**

```bash
# Write to temp files first, then move atomically
cp new-cert.pem /etc/yuzu/certs/server.crt.tmp
cp new-key.pem /etc/yuzu/certs/server.key.tmp
chmod 600 /etc/yuzu/certs/server.key.tmp
mv /etc/yuzu/certs/server.crt.tmp /etc/yuzu/certs/server.crt
mv /etc/yuzu/certs/server.key.tmp /etc/yuzu/certs/server.key
```

**Observability:**

- Log messages: `cert-reload: certificate hot-reloaded successfully` or `cert-reload: ... failed`
- Audit events: action `cert.reload` with result `success` or `failure`
- Metrics: `yuzu_server_cert_reloads_total` (counter), `yuzu_server_cert_reload_failures_total` (counter)

**Limitations:**

- **HTTPS only.** gRPC mTLS certificate hot-reload is not supported. Rotating gRPC certificates still requires a server restart.
- The server logs a warning at startup if gRPC TLS is enabled with cert reload: *"gRPC TLS certificate hot-reload is not yet supported."*

## User Management

Yuzu supports two built-in roles for local users:

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Full access to all features, including Settings, user management, agent enrollment, and instruction execution. |
| `user` | Read-only access to the dashboard, agent list, and query results. Cannot modify settings or execute instructions. |

### Creating a User

1. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**.
2. Enter a username, password, and select a role.
3. Click **Create User**.

The password is hashed with PBKDF2 before storage. Plaintext passwords are never written to disk.

> **Breaking change in v0.12.0** — the `role` field is **ignored** on
> create. New users are always created as `user`. To grant admin, use
> the **Change Role** button on the user's row, or `POST
> /api/settings/users/{username}/role` programmatically. This is a
> deliberate split (security finding C1): collapsing role assignment
> into the create endpoint allowed a 4xx-on-create + audit-as-success
> pattern that operators couldn't audit cleanly. Each role transition
> now produces a single `user.role_change` audit event with `old_role`
> and `new_role` recorded in the detail field.

### Changing a User's Role

1. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**.
2. Click **Change Role** next to the target user.
3. Pick `admin` or `user` and confirm.

The server emits an audit event on every branch:

| Branch | Audit `result` | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Role changed | `success` | `old_role=user,new_role=admin` (or vice versa) |
| Same role requested | `no_op` | `same_role=admin` (or `user`) |
| Self-target rejected | `denied` | `self_role_change_blocked` |
| Invalid username | `denied` | `invalid_username` |
| Invalid JSON body | `denied` | `invalid_json` |
| Missing `role` field | `denied` | `missing_role` |
| Invalid role value | `denied` | `invalid_role` |
| User not found | `denied` | `user_not_found` |
| DB write failed | `denied` | `db_failure` |

> **You cannot change your own role.** The endpoint rejects self-target
> with HTTP 403, audited as `denied:self_role_change_blocked`. The same
> motivation as the self-delete guard: prevent an operator from locking
> themselves out via a misclick or scripted demotion.

> **Active sessions are invalidated atomically.** After a successful
> `user.role_change`, every active session for the target user is
> destroyed; the user must re-authenticate to pick up the new role.

### Deleting a User

1. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**.
2. Click **Remove** next to the target user.
3. Confirm the deletion.

> **Note:** You cannot delete your own account. The Users table renders
> the text "Current user" in place of the **Remove** button for the
> currently authenticated operator's row, and the server rejects any
> hand-crafted `DELETE /api/settings/users/<your-username>` request with
> HTTP 403 and a `Cannot delete your own account` toast. This prevents
> a misclick — or a scripted revoke loop — from dropping the only
> credential on the running server and locking every operator out
> until the process is restarted against its on-disk config. To remove
> the account you are signed in as, first create a second admin, log
> out, log in as the second admin, and delete the original.

---

### Force-logging out a user (incident response)

Use this when an account credential is suspected of compromise but the
account itself should remain functional (the user reports a stolen
laptop but still needs to keep working from a clean device, or a
short-lived contractor's badge is being rotated).

1. Navigate to **Settings > User Management**.
2. Click **Revoke sessions** next to the target user.
3. Confirm the blast-radius warning. The user's active dashboard
   sessions end immediately; their account remains intact and they
   can re-authenticate normally.

The audit log records `session.revoke_all` with `target_id=<username>`,
`target_type=User`, and `detail=count=<N>` where N is the number of
in-memory cookie sessions wiped. The action is also surfaced on the
`yuzu_auth_sessions_revoked_total{caller="admin",scope="cookies"}`
Prometheus counter — a sustained spike there is the operator's
automated alert for either a real incident response in progress or
a misbehaving automation script.

> **API tokens are not revoked by this flow.** Use it for a leaked
> session cookie. If the user's API tokens are also implicated, either
> revoke them individually via Settings → API Tokens or instruct the
> user to click **Sign out everywhere** themselves (see below), which
> revokes both cookies and tokens.

> **Verify persistence after a partial failure.** If the response body
> reports `db_persisted: false` (or the audit row shows `result=partial`
> with `db_error=true`), the in-memory wipe succeeded but the
> persisted `auth.db` rows survive. A server restart will resurrect
> those sessions. Either retry the revoke after the DB lock clears, or
> see `docs/ops-runbooks/auth-db-recovery.md` for emergency manual
> revocation via the SQLite CLI.

### Self-service "Sign out everywhere"

Any user — not just admins — can wipe every credential bearing their
identity by clicking the **Sign out everywhere** button on their own
row in Settings → Users. Unlike the admin **Revoke sessions** button,
this revokes BOTH cookie sessions AND every API token the user owns
(the lost-laptop scenario must kill every credential, not just
browser cookies). After the request the page redirects to `/login`
and the response clears the session cookie via `Set-Cookie: Max-Age=0`.

> **MCP-tier and service-scoped tokens cannot self-revoke.** Those
> credential classes have no other write privilege; accepting a
> self-revoke from one would create a novel DoS surface against the
> human owner. The endpoint returns 403 and the audit row records
> `session.revoke_all.self` with `result=denied`. Use the dashboard
> from a password-authenticated session.

---

## Agent Enrollment

Yuzu uses a tiered enrollment model. Each tier provides a different balance of security and convenience.

### Tier 1: Manual Approval

The default enrollment method. No pre-shared token is required.

1. The agent starts and sends a `RegisterRequest` to the server.
2. The server places the agent in the **pending queue**.
3. An admin reviews pending agents in **Settings > Pending Agents**.
4. The admin approves or denies each agent.
5. Approved agents complete registration on their next heartbeat.
6. Denied agents are removed from the queue. They can re-register if restarted.

### Tier 2: Pre-Shared Token

For automated or bulk deployment. Agents present a token at startup for instant enrollment.

**Server side:**
1. Navigate to **Settings > Enrollment Tokens**.
2. Click **Generate Token**.
3. Configure token properties:
   - **Expiry** -- time limit (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).
   - **Max uses** -- how many agents can use this token (1 for single-device, unlimited for bulk).
4. Copy the generated token string.

**Agent side:**
```bash
./yuzu-agent --enrollment-token "TOKEN_STRING"
```

The agent passes the token in `RegisterRequest.enrollment_token`. If the token is valid and not expired or exhausted, the agent is enrolled immediately.

### Tier 3: Platform Trust (Planned)

Reserved protocol fields (`machine_certificate`, `attestation_signature`, `attestation_provider`) support future integration with:
- Windows certificate store (machine certificates)
- Azure Attestation
- Cloud instance identity documents (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### Auto-Approval Policies

For environments that need something between manual approval and pre-shared tokens, auto-approval policies can automatically approve agents that match defined criteria:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Auto-Approval Policies**.
2. Create a rule with conditions (e.g., hostname matches `prod-web-*`, source IP in `10.0.0.0/8`).
3. Agents matching any active policy are approved automatically at registration time.

---

## OTA Agent Updates

The server can distribute agent binary updates to enrolled endpoints.

### Uploading a New Version

1. Navigate to **Settings > OTA Updates**.
2. Click **Upload** and select the agent binary.
3. The server stores the binary and assigns a version identifier.

### Promoting to Production

1. In the OTA Updates list, locate the uploaded version.
2. Click **Promote** to mark it as the current production version.
3. Agents check for updates on their next heartbeat and download the new binary automatically.

### Managing Versions

- View all uploaded versions with their upload date, size, and promotion status.
- Delete old versions to reclaim storage.
- Only one version can be promoted (active) at a time.

---

## Vulnerability Rule Management

The `vuln_scan` plugin uses a ruleset of known CVEs to detect vulnerable software and kernel versions. Rules are loaded at runtime from a JSON file, allowing updates without agent restart.

### Automatic Weekly Rule Updates

The Yuzu GitHub repository includes a weekly GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/update-cve-rules.yml`) that automatically:

1. Fetches the latest CVE data from the NIST NVD API v2 (31 product keywords)
2. Filters by severity (default: HIGH and CRITICAL)
3. Generates `content/cve_rules.json` with the latest rules
4. Validates the JSON schema and test-loads into the plugin
5. Opens a pull request for review before merging

**Workflow schedule:** Every Sunday at 02:00 UTC, or via manual trigger.

**To use automated updates:**
- Enable GitHub Actions in your Yuzu fork
- Optionally, set the `NVD_API_KEY` repository secret to increase the NVD API rate limit from 5 req/30s to 50 req/30s (free key available at https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/api/key-request)
- Merged rule updates are published as GitHub Releases and can be downloaded for offline deployment

### Manual Rule Generation (Air-Gapped Deployments)

For deployments without GitHub Actions access, use the standalone rule generator:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-cve-rules.py --min-severity HIGH
```

This generates `content/cve_rules.json` and `content/cve_rules.json.sha256` for offline deployment.

### Deploying Rule Updates to Endpoints

Once you have a new `cve_rules.json`:

1. Stage the file using the `content_dist.stage` action:
   ```
   InstructionSet: content_distribution
   Action: stage
   Parameters:
     url: https://yourserver/path/to/cve_rules.json
     filename: cve_rules.json
     sha256: <hash from cve_rules.json.sha256>
   ```

2. Send the `vuln_scan.update_rules` action to trigger reload:
   ```
   InstructionSet: vuln_scan
   Action: update_rules
   ```

3. After ~30 seconds, the new rules are active on all target endpoints. The plugin verifies the SHA-256 before loading to prevent tampering.

**Built-in fallback:** If the staged JSON file is unavailable or fails verification, endpoints retain their compiled-in critical CVE ruleset, ensuring continuous protection.

### Rule Format and Validation

Rules use the `yuzu.vuln` schema (version 1):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "rules": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2024-0001",
      "product": "openssl",
      "affected_below": "3.0.4",
      "fixed_in": "3.0.4",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "description": "Buffer overflow in X509 parsing"
    }
  ]
}
```

Validate locally before deployment:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-cve-rules.py --validate-only
```

## RBAC Management

Role-Based Access Control adds granular permissions beyond the built-in admin/user roles.

### Enabling RBAC

1. Navigate to **Settings > RBAC Management**.
2. Toggle **Enable RBAC**.
3. When RBAC is enabled, the system enforces fine-grained permissions based on assigned roles.

### Built-in vs. Custom Roles

| Aspect | Built-in Roles | Custom Roles (RBAC) |
|---|---|---|
| Granularity | Two roles: admin, user | Per-operation permissions on securable types |
| Assignment | Per-user | Per-principal (users, service accounts, API tokens) |
| Management groups | Not scoped | Permissions can be scoped to management groups |

### Creating a Role

1. Navigate to **Settings > RBAC Management**.
2. Click **Create Role**.
3. Name the role and assign permissions for each securable type and operation.

For the full RBAC model, see `docs/user-manual/rbac.md`.

---

## Tag Compliance

The Tag Compliance section provides a fleet-wide view of compliance based on tag-driven policies.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Tag Compliance**.
2. View the compliance summary showing:
   - Total devices, compliant count, non-compliant count.
   - Breakdown by tag category.
   - Devices missing required tags.

Tag compliance data is also available via the REST API (`GET /api/v1/tag-compliance`) for integration with external dashboards and reporting tools.

---

## OIDC SSO Configuration

Yuzu supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) for single sign-on with external identity providers such as Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Okta, or any OIDC-compliant provider.

### Configuration

OIDC can be configured via CLI flags at startup or through the Settings page:

| Parameter | CLI Flag | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Issuer URL | `--oidc-issuer` | The OIDC discovery endpoint base URL. |
| Client ID | `--oidc-client-id` | Application (client) ID from your identity provider. |
| Client Secret | `--oidc-client-secret` | Client secret for the confidential client flow. |
| Redirect URI | `--oidc-redirect-uri` | Callback URL registered with the identity provider. Must point to the Yuzu server's `/auth/callback` path. |
| Admin Group | `--oidc-admin-group` | Entra ID group object ID that maps to the admin role. |
| Skip TLS Verify | `--oidc-skip-tls-verify` | Disable TLS cert verification for OIDC endpoints (insecure, dev only). Env: `YUZU_OIDC_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY`. |

### Identity Provider Setup

1. Register Yuzu as an application in your identity provider.
2. Set the redirect URI to `https://<yuzu-server>:<port>/auth/callback`.
3. Note the client ID and client secret.
4. Enter these values in the Yuzu Settings page or pass them as CLI flags.

### User Mapping

OIDC-authenticated users are mapped to Yuzu roles based on claims or group membership. The mapping configuration depends on your identity provider and is set in the OIDC section of the Settings page.

## Data Storage and Encryption

Yuzu stores persistent data in SQLite databases, including the response store, analytics event store, audit log, and RBAC store. By default, database files are created in the same directory as the `yuzu-server.cfg` config file. Use `--data-dir` to place databases in a separate writable directory (required for containerized deployments where the config file is on a read-only mount).

> **Important: SQLite databases are not encrypted at rest.** The `.db` files contain query results, audit logs, and agent metadata in plaintext on disk. Any user or process with read access to the filesystem can read this data.

### Protecting Data at Rest

Operators must use full-disk encryption to protect Yuzu data at rest:

| Platform | Recommended Solution | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | dm-crypt / LUKS | Encrypt the partition or volume where Yuzu data resides. Most distributions support LUKS during OS installation. |
| Windows | BitLocker | Enable BitLocker on the drive containing the Yuzu server directory. Requires TPM or startup key. |
| macOS | FileVault | Enable FileVault in System Settings. Encrypts the entire startup volume. |

For containerized deployments (Docker Compose), ensure the host volume backing `server-data` is on an encrypted filesystem.

> **Planned:** A future `--encrypt-db` option will add application-level SQLite encryption using SQLCipher, providing defense-in-depth independent of disk encryption. Track progress in the roadmap (Phase 7).

---

## Retention Settings

The server applies retention policies to stored data to manage disk usage. Retention values are set via CLI flags at startup.

| Data Type | CLI Flag | Default TTL | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instruction responses | `--response-retention-days` | 90 days | Results from executed instructions. Older responses are purged on a daily schedule. |
| Audit log entries | `--audit-retention-days` | 365 days | Records of who did what, when, and on which devices. |
| Guardian (Guaranteed State) events | `--guardian-event-retention-days` | 30 days | Guaranteed State drift events, remediation events, and agent-sync events written by the Guardian engine. See [Guaranteed State](guaranteed-state.md) for the feature context. |

Reducing the TTL frees disk space; increasing it preserves history for compliance.

> **Note:** All three retention values can also be set via environment variables (`YUZU_RESPONSE_RETENTION_DAYS`, `YUZU_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`, `YUZU_GUARDIAN_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS`) and can be updated at runtime via `PUT /api/v1/config/<key>` with an `Infrastructure:Write` permission. Runtime updates are persisted via `RuntimeConfigStore` and reflected immediately in the `/api/v1/config` GET response — **but the running store captures its retention value at construction time and does not re-read it, so TTL computation on new inserts continues to use the startup value until the next server restart.** This "takes effect on restart" limitation is shared across all three retention keys and is tracked as issue #483.

## File Logging

Yuzu writes logs to stdout by default. File logging is opt-in via `--log-file`, with a best-effort fallback at the platform default path (`/var/log/yuzu/server.log` on Linux, `C:\ProgramData\Yuzu\logs\server.log` on Windows, `~/Library/Logs/Yuzu/server.log` on macOS).

| Path | Behaviour | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|
| `--log-file <path>` (explicit) | Writes to `<path>` in addition to stdout. | If the file/directory cannot be opened, server logs an ERROR and continues without file logging. |
| Platform default path (implicit) | Writes to the platform default path if it exists and is writable. | If the directory cannot be created or the file cannot be opened, server logs a single INFO line and continues without file logging. The default fallback is best-effort observability, not load-bearing. |

The Docker server image pre-creates `/var/log/yuzu` (mode 0750, owned by the `yuzu` user) so the implicit default path works out of the box. When mounting an external host volume at `/var/log/yuzu`, ensure the host directory is owned by the same UID as the in-container `yuzu` user (verify with `docker exec yuzu-server id yuzu`); a wrong-ownership mount silently degrades to stdout-only logging.

## Health Endpoints

Yuzu exposes four HTTP probe endpoints for orchestrators, load balancers, and monitoring integrations. All four are unauthenticated and exempt from the API rate limiter.

| Path | Use case | Body | Draining-aware |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/livez` | Kubernetes liveness probe — fast check that the HTTP listener is up. | `{"status":"ok"}` | No |
| `/readyz` | Kubernetes readiness probe — covers per-store migration completion AND graceful-shutdown drain. | `{"status":"ready"}` (200) or `{"status":"draining"}` (503) | **Yes** |
| `/health` | Monitoring dashboards (Prometheus blackbox exporter, Datadog, Nagios). Rich JSON with per-store status, agent counts, execution stats, and version. | Structured JSON — see [REST API: Health](rest-api.md#health). | No |
| `/api/health` | Identical alias of `/health`, provided for monitoring integrations that prefix every REST call with `/api/`. Restored in v0.12.0 (issue #620). | Identical to `/health`. | No |

**Choose the right endpoint for your use case.** Load balancers that should drain in-flight traffic during a rolling deploy MUST use `/readyz` — `/health` and `/api/health` continue returning 200 during shutdown by design (Kubernetes pattern: liveness/health probes are not draining-aware). Aggressive monitoring poll cadences (sub-second) should target `/livez` rather than `/health` to minimise per-probe SQLite touches.

## Deployment

Yuzu provides multiple deployment options: Docker Compose for quick setup, systemd units for bare-metal Linux, and a development stack script for local testing.

### Docker Compose

The default Docker deployment runs the server and agent standalone -- no gateway required. For scaled deployments with a gateway, see `docker-compose.full-uat.yml`.

**Files:**

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.server` | Multi-stage build for the Yuzu server binary |
| `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.gateway` | Erlang/OTP build for the gateway node |
| `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml` | Build-from-source dev stack (server + agent + monitoring) |
| `deploy/docker/docker-compose.reference.yml` | Copyable deployment template — pulls pinned ghcr.io images, uses a named `server-data` volume, carries inline TLS hardening + backup + rollback commentary. Requires operator hardening (TLS, bind address) before production use. |
| `deploy/docker/docker-compose.full-uat.yml` | Gateway deployment (server + gateway + monitoring) |
| `docker-compose.uat.yml` | Self-contained single-file UAT stack pulled from ghcr.io (server + gateway + Prometheus + Grafana + ClickHouse) |
| `deploy/docker/docker-compose.demo.yml` | Chiselled (FROM scratch) Ubuntu 26.04 sales-demo stack — server + gateway + N agent replicas, release-pinned. Entry point `scripts/start-demo.sh`; see `docs/demo-environment.md`. Not for production (runs `--no-tls` with a baked admin password). |

**Usage:**

```bash
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up -d          # start all services
docker compose logs -f        # follow logs
docker compose down           # stop all services
```

**Pinning a specific release with `docker-compose.uat.yml`:**

The top-level UAT compose file parameterises its `ghcr.io/.../yuzu-server` and `yuzu-gateway` tags through `${YUZU_VERSION:-<default>}`. The default tracks the latest published release, but operators testing an earlier or newer image can override at the command line:

```bash
YUZU_VERSION=0.9.0 docker compose -f docker-compose.uat.yml up -d
```

A GitHub Actions check (`scripts/check-compose-versions.sh`) runs as the first step of the release workflow and blocks asset publication if any tracked compose file carries a hardcoded `X.Y.Z` tag or a `${YUZU_VERSION:-...}` default that does not match the release tag — so the default in the checked-in file is guaranteed to match the latest shipped release.

**Exposed ports:**

| Port | Service | Deployment |
|---|---|---|
| 8080 | Web dashboard + REST API | Always |
| 50051 | gRPC (agent connections) | Always -- server in standalone, gateway in scaled |
| 50052 | gRPC (management) | Always |
| 50055 | gRPC (gateway upstream) | Gateway deployments only |
| 50063 | gRPC (gateway command forwarding) | Gateway deployments only |
| 8081 | Gateway health/readiness | Gateway deployments only |
| 9568 | Gateway Prometheus metrics | Gateway deployments only |
| 9090 | Prometheus | Monitoring stack |
| 3000 | Grafana (default login: admin/admin) | Monitoring stack |

**Volumes:** `server-data`, `agent-data`, `prometheus-data`, and `grafana-data` are persisted across container restarts.

### systemd Units

For bare-metal Linux deployments, systemd service files are provided for each component.

**Files:**

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `deploy/systemd/yuzu-server.service` | Yuzu server unit |
| `deploy/systemd/yuzu-agent.service` | Yuzu agent unit |
| `deploy/systemd/yuzu-gateway.service` | Erlang gateway unit |

**Installation:**

```bash
# Copy binaries
sudo cp builddir/yuzu-server /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp builddir/yuzu-agent /usr/local/bin/

# Create service user
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home yuzu

# Install units
sudo cp deploy/systemd/yuzu-server.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable yuzu-server
sudo systemctl start yuzu-server
```

**Security hardening:** The systemd units include `NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome=true`, and `PrivateTmp=true` for defense-in-depth.

### Development Stack Script

The `scripts/start-stack.sh` script starts the full development stack locally (without Docker).

**Components started:**

1. `yuzu-server` -- gRPC on :50051, web on :8080
2. Erlang gateway -- agent gRPC on :50051, metrics on :9568
3. `yuzu-agent` -- connects to gateway on :50051
4. Prometheus -- scraper on :9090
5. Grafana -- dashboards on :3000

**Usage:**

```bash
bash scripts/start-stack.sh          # start all components
bash scripts/start-stack.sh stop     # kill all components
bash scripts/start-stack.sh status   # show running processes and ports
```

## Windows Service Installation

On Windows, Yuzu server and agent can be installed as Windows services for automatic startup and recovery. A native Windows service wrapper is planned for a future release; until then, use `sc.exe` or NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager).

### Using sc.exe

```cmd
REM Create the Yuzu server service
sc.exe create YuzuServer binPath= "C:\Yuzu\yuzu-server.exe --https-cert C:\Yuzu\certs\server.crt --https-key C:\Yuzu\certs\server.key" start= auto DisplayName= "Yuzu Server"

REM Create the Yuzu agent service
sc.exe create YuzuAgent binPath= "C:\Yuzu\yuzu-agent.exe --server-address yuzu.example.com:50051" start= auto DisplayName= "Yuzu Agent"

REM Set startup type to automatic (delayed start, recommended)
sc.exe config YuzuServer start= delayed-auto
sc.exe config YuzuAgent start= delayed-auto

REM Configure recovery: restart on first, second, and subsequent failures
sc.exe failure YuzuServer reset= 86400 actions= restart/5000/restart/10000/restart/30000
sc.exe failure YuzuAgent reset= 86400 actions= restart/5000/restart/10000/restart/30000

REM Start the services
sc.exe start YuzuServer
sc.exe start YuzuAgent

REM Stop the services
sc.exe stop YuzuServer
sc.exe stop YuzuAgent
```

> **Note:** With `sc.exe`, spaces after `=` are required (e.g., `start= auto`, not `start=auto`). This is a quirk of the `sc.exe` command parser.

### Using NSSM

[NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) provides a more user-friendly wrapper with a GUI configuration dialog.

```cmd
REM Install services
nssm install YuzuServer "C:\Yuzu\yuzu-server.exe"
nssm install YuzuAgent "C:\Yuzu\yuzu-agent.exe"

REM Set arguments
nssm set YuzuServer AppParameters "--https-cert C:\Yuzu\certs\server.crt --https-key C:\Yuzu\certs\server.key"
nssm set YuzuAgent AppParameters "--server-address yuzu.example.com:50051"

REM Configure startup and recovery
nssm set YuzuServer Start SERVICE_DELAYED_AUTO_START
nssm set YuzuAgent Start SERVICE_DELAYED_AUTO_START

REM Configure stdout/stderr logging
nssm set YuzuServer AppStdout "C:\Yuzu\logs\server-stdout.log"
nssm set YuzuServer AppStderr "C:\Yuzu\logs\server-stderr.log"
nssm set YuzuAgent AppStdout "C:\Yuzu\logs\agent-stdout.log"
nssm set YuzuAgent AppStderr "C:\Yuzu\logs\agent-stderr.log"

REM Start the services
nssm start YuzuServer
nssm start YuzuAgent
```

### Service Account

For production deployments, create a dedicated service account with minimal permissions rather than running as `LocalSystem`:

1. Create a local user account (e.g., `YuzuSvc`) with no interactive logon rights.
2. Grant the account read/write access to the Yuzu installation directory and data directory only.
3. Assign the "Log on as a service" right via Local Security Policy (`secpol.msc`).
4. Configure the service to run as this account: `sc.exe config YuzuServer obj= ".\YuzuSvc" password= "PASSWORD"`.

> **Planned:** A native Windows service wrapper (`yuzu-server --install-service`) is planned for a future release, which will handle service registration, recovery configuration, and Event Log integration automatically.
