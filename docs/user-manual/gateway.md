# Yuzu Gateway

The Yuzu gateway is an Erlang/OTP application that sits between agents and the
C++ server, enabling the platform to scale beyond the connection limits of a
single server process.

## Overview

**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

At scale, the C++ server's single-process gRPC architecture hits limits:
each Subscribe bidi stream holds a per-agent mutex, and broadcast operations
iterate all agents serially. At millions of agents this creates lock convoys,
thread exhaustion, and single-box ceilings.

The gateway solves this by owning the **command fanout plane** (Subscribe
bidi streams to agents, command dispatch, response aggregation) while the
C++ server retains the **control plane** (enrollment, auth, inventory,
dashboard, REST API).

The key scaling insight is that Erlang can sustain millions of lightweight
processes, each holding the state for one agent's bidi stream, with no
mutexes -- message passing provides serialization.

               +------------------+
```

**Plane separation:**

| Plane | Owner | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| Control | yuzu-server (C++) | Register, Heartbeat, enrollment, auth, inventory, dashboard, REST API, mTLS termination |
| Command | yuzu-gateway (Erlang) | Subscribe bidi streams, SendCommand fanout, response aggregation, streaming relay |

### OTP Process Model

Each connected agent is represented by a single Erlang process (`yuzu_gw_agent`,
a `gen_statem` state machine). The process owns the gRPC stream writer handle;
all writes to that agent go through its mailbox with no mutex contention.

**Agent process states:**

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| `connecting` | Agent called Register; forwarded to upstream server; awaiting session_id |
| `streaming` | Bidi stream active; agent process owns the stream writer |
| `disconnected` | Stream broken or heartbeat timeout; cleanup and termination |

Memory per agent process is approximately 2 KB base plus the pending command
map. At 1 million agents this is 2--4 GB, trivially shardable across a cluster.

### Module Inventory

The gateway source lives in `gateway/apps/yuzu_gw/src/`:

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `yuzu_gw_app` | OTP application behaviour |
| `yuzu_gw_sup` | Top-level supervisor |
| `yuzu_gw_agent_sup` | `simple_one_for_one` supervisor for agent processes |
| `yuzu_gw_agent` | `gen_statem`: one process per agent bidi stream |
| `yuzu_gw_registry` | Process groups + ETS routing table |
| `yuzu_gw_router` | Command fanout coordinator |
| `yuzu_gw_upstream` | gRPC client pool to the C++ server |
| `yuzu_gw_agent_service` | Agent-facing gRPC server (AgentService proxy) |
| `yuzu_gw_mgmt_service` | Operator-facing gRPC server (ManagementService proxy) |
| `yuzu_gw_telemetry` | Telemetry event definitions and handlers |
| `yuzu_gw_gauge` | Periodic gauge emission for Prometheus |
| `yuzu_gw_proto` | Protobuf encode/decode wrappers |

---

## Core Proxy Functions

**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Register Proxy

When an agent calls `Register`, the gateway's `yuzu_gw_agent_service` forwards
the request to the C++ server via `yuzu_gw_upstream:proxy_register/1`. The
server handles enrollment logic (token validation, pending approval queue)
and returns a `RegisterResponse` with a session ID. The gateway relays the
response to the agent and starts an agent process.

### Heartbeat Batching

Individual agent heartbeats are not forwarded one-by-one. Instead,
`yuzu_gw_upstream` buffers heartbeats and sends them in a single
`BatchHeartbeat` RPC at a configurable interval (default: 10 seconds).

This reduces upstream load from O(agents/interval) to O(nodes/interval).

On RPC failure, heartbeat buffers are retained (capped at 10,000) for retry
on the next flush cycle rather than being silently discarded.

### Subscribe Stream Proxy

The gateway owns the agent's Subscribe bidi stream. When an operator sends a
command via `SendCommand`, the `yuzu_gw_router` fans it out to the target
agent processes, which write to their respective streams. Responses flow back
through the agent process mailbox to the router and are aggregated for the
operator.

### Inventory Proxy

Full inventory reports from agents are forwarded to the C++ server via
`ProxyInventory` for storage and querying.

### Stream Status Notification

When an agent's Subscribe stream connects or disconnects at the gateway, a
`NotifyStreamStatus` RPC informs the C++ server so it can update its
connectivity records.

## GatewayUpstream Service

**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

The `GatewayUpstream` service is a gRPC service exposed by the C++ server
specifically for gateway communication. It is defined in
`proto/yuzu/gateway/v1/gateway.proto`.

### RPCs

| RPC | Request | Response | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ProxyRegister` | `RegisterRequest` | `RegisterResponse` | Forward agent registration to control plane |
| `BatchHeartbeat` | `BatchHeartbeatRequest` | `BatchHeartbeatResponse` | Aggregated heartbeats from all agents on one gateway node |
| `ProxyInventory` | `InventoryReport` | `InventoryAck` | Forward inventory reports to storage layer |
| `NotifyStreamStatus` | `StreamStatusNotification` | `StreamStatusAck` | Inform server of agent connect/disconnect events |

### BatchHeartbeat Message

```protobuf
message BatchHeartbeatRequest {
  repeated HeartbeatRequest heartbeats = 1;
  string gateway_node = 2;
}

message BatchHeartbeatResponse {
  int32 acknowledged_count = 1;
}
```

### StreamStatusNotification Message

```protobuf
message StreamStatusNotification {
  string agent_id   = 1;
  string session_id = 2;
  enum Event {
    CONNECTED    = 0;
    DISCONNECTED = 1;
  }
  Event event       = 3;
  string peer_addr  = 4;
  string gateway_node = 5;
}
```

---

## Configuration

The gateway is configured via `gateway/config/sys.config`. Key settings:

```erlang
{yuzu_gw, [
    %% Agent-facing gRPC (agents connect here)
    {agent_listen_addr, "0.0.0.0"},
    {agent_listen_port, 50051},

    %% Operator-facing gRPC (dashboard/CLI)
    {mgmt_listen_addr, "0.0.0.0"},
    {mgmt_listen_port, 50052},

    %% Upstream C++ server (GatewayUpstream service)
    {upstream_addr, "127.0.0.1"},
    {upstream_port, 50051},

    %% Upstream connection pool size
    {upstream_pool_size, 16},

    %% Heartbeat batching interval (ms)
    {heartbeat_batch_interval_ms, 10000},

    %% Default command timeout (seconds)
    {default_command_timeout_s, 300},

    %% Prometheus metrics HTTP port
    {prometheus_port, 9568},

    %% Agent telemetry gauge emission interval (ms)
    {telemetry_gauge_interval_ms, 10000},

    %% Consistent hash ring: virtual nodes per physical node
    {hash_ring_vnodes, 256}
]}
```

### TLS Configuration (Optional)

To enable mTLS between agents and the gateway, add the `tls` key:

```erlang
{tls, [
    {certfile, "/etc/yuzu/gateway.crt"},
    {keyfile,  "/etc/yuzu/gateway.key"},
    {cacertfile, "/etc/yuzu/ca.crt"},
    {verify, verify_peer},
    {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}
]}
```

### Distribution Cookie (Required in Production)

The gateway enables Erlang distribution (`-name` in `config/vm.args.src`) for
clustering and remote-shell/`recon` access. The distribution **cookie is the
sole authentication for inter-node RPC** — any host that can reach EPMD
(TCP 4369) with the cookie can execute arbitrary code on the gateway node.

Supply it at boot from the `YUZU_GW_COOKIE` environment variable:

```bash
export YUZU_GW_COOKIE="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"   # strong, unique per cluster
```

If `YUZU_GW_COOKIE` is unset, `vm.args.src` falls back to the historical
default and the boot guard (`yuzu_gw_app:check_distribution_cookie/0`)
**refuses to start** — it fails closed, because a known cookie is
unauthenticated RCE (#659). For local dev/CI where distribution is not
exposed, override the guard with `YUZU_GW_ALLOW_DEFAULT_COOKIE=1`. All nodes
in a cluster must share the same cookie.

> **Never set `YUZU_GW_ALLOW_DEFAULT_COOKIE=1` in production.** It disables the
> boot guard and restores the unauthenticated inter-node RPC surface (#659); it
> exists only for ephemeral dev/CI stacks (where it appears in the UAT compose
> files). On `.deb`/`.rpm` installs the cookie is auto-generated into
> `/etc/yuzu/gateway.env`. **Rotate** it by writing a new value there — and to
> every cluster node identically — then restarting the gateway.

### Server-Side Setup

The C++ server must be started with the `--gateway-upstream` flag specifying
the address and port for the GatewayUpstream service. This port must match
`upstream_port` in `sys.config`:

```bash
yuzu-server --gateway-upstream "0.0.0.0:50051"
```

> **Known limitation — gateway origin-IP attribution (#1064).** On the gateway
> `ProxyRegister` path, audit rows currently record the **gateway node's** IP as
> `source_ip`, not the originating agent's IP. The server already consumes the
> `RegisterRequest.gateway_observed_peer` field that carries the agent origin
> (recording `source_ip`=agent origin and `gateway_ip`=transport peer when
> present), but the gateway does not yet populate it — today's grpcbox transport
> cannot observe the direct agent peer, and the durable source arrives with the
> QUIC transport migration (#376). Until then, SIEM/audit consumers correlating
> `source_ip` with network logs on this path will see the gateway's address.

## Gateway Clustering

> **Status: PLANNED -- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (Issue 7.1.1)**

The current gateway runs as a single Erlang node. Planned clustering support
will enable multiple gateway nodes to form a distributed cluster for
horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.

### Planned Features

**Adjacency table:** Each gateway node maintains a routing table mapping agent
IDs to the owning node. When a command targets an agent on a different node,
the router forwards it via Erlang distribution.

**Load shedding via GOAWAY:** When a gateway node is overloaded, it sends
HTTP/2 GOAWAY frames to agents, causing them to reconnect. A load balancer
directs them to less-loaded nodes.

**Agent absorption:** When a gateway node shuts down (planned or crash), its
agents reconnect and are absorbed by the remaining nodes. The adjacency table
is updated via Erlang's node monitoring (`net_kernel:monitor_nodes/1`).

**Latency-based redistribution:** Agents periodically report their round-trip
latency to the gateway. If a closer node is available, the agent is migrated
via a controlled GOAWAY + reconnect cycle.

**Stability mechanisms:**
- Cooldown period after redistribution to prevent oscillation.
- Hysteresis thresholds -- an agent is only migrated if the latency improvement
  exceeds a configurable minimum.
- Rate limiting on GOAWAY frames to prevent thundering herd.

## Prometheus Metrics

**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

The gateway exposes Prometheus metrics on a configurable HTTP port (default:
9568). The `yuzu_gw_telemetry` module defines telemetry events, and
`yuzu_gw_gauge` periodically emits gauge values.

### Available Metrics

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `yuzu_gw_agents_connected` | gauge | Number of currently connected agents |
| `yuzu_gw_commands_dispatched_total` | counter | Total commands dispatched to agents |
| `yuzu_gw_commands_completed_total` | counter | Total commands completed (by status) |
| `yuzu_gw_heartbeats_batched_total` | counter | Total heartbeats sent in batch RPCs |
| `yuzu_gw_upstream_rpc_duration_seconds` | histogram | Upstream RPC latency by method |
| `yuzu_gw_upstream_rpc_errors_total` | counter | Upstream RPC failures by method |
| `yuzu_gw_registration_replay_total` | counter | Agents re-proxied upstream by the registration-replay drip after an upstream reconnect |
| `yuzu_gw_registration_replay_queue_depth` | gauge | Agents still queued for registration replay (0 = idle). A persistently non-zero value indicates a replay that never drains — alert on it. |

### Planned Metrics (Not Yet Implemented)

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `yuzu_gw_cluster_nodes` | gauge | Number of nodes in the gateway cluster |
| `yuzu_gw_agent_migrations_total` | counter | Agents migrated between nodes |
| `yuzu_gw_goaway_sent_total` | counter | GOAWAY frames sent for load shedding |

### Scrape Configuration

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'yuzu-gateway'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['gateway-host:9568']
    scrape_interval: 15s
```
