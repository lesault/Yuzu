/// CIDR containment for the #1128 NAT-aware per-session peer-IP binding.

/// `peer_ip.hpp` deliberately hand-rolls IP *validation* so it can stay
/// header-only and free of platform networking headers. CIDR *containment*
/// needs inet_pton-class parsing (IPv4 + IPv6, byte-array prefix masking), so it
/// lives in a .cpp that owns the `<ws2tcpip.h>` / `<arpa/inet.h>` includes —
/// keeping those out of the widely-included peer_ip.hpp.
///
/// Distinct from auth/auto_approve.cpp's IPv4-only `match_ip_subnet`: that one
/// is a private AutoApproveEngine method and throws (`std::stoi`) on a malformed
/// prefix. These are free functions, IPv4+IPv6, and never throw — a future
/// consolidation could fold auto_approve onto these.
